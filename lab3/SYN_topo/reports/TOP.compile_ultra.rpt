Warning: Congestion optimization is enabled as part of the physical guidance flow. (OPT-1445)
Warning: The compile_timing_high_effort variable is a hidden variable. When setting this variable to true with the compile_ultra command, the tool performs higher effort optimizations, resulting in a longer runtime than running compile_ultra without the variable. Use compile_ultra without the variable as the default optimization strategy, and enable the variable only when your design requires further timing optimization. 
Note: The -timing_high_effort_script option is not required to enable the compile_timing_high_effort variable. (OPT-1343)
